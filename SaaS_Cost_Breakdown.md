## Key Takeaways

- **MVP Launch:** You can launch for <$100/month in infra if you use serverless and free tiers, but OpenAI costs will scale with usage.
- **OpenAI is the main variable cost**—monitor usage and consider caching or batching requests.
- **Development is the largest up-front cost** unless you build it yourself.
- **As you scale, infra, support, and compliance become significant.**
